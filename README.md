## Inheritance

Create an inheritance smart contract in Solidity. 
This smart contract should allow the owner to withdraw ETH from the contract. 
If the owner does not withdraw ETH from the contract for more than 1 month an heir can take control of the contract and designate a new hair. 
It should be possible for the owner to withdraw 0 ETH just to reset the one month counter.
